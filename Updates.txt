UPDATES!

2-18-21: Added default queries to show default batting and pitching stats as well as general information.

2-19-21: Fixed default batting query to also display OPS. Added information on how to load the created database (you do not create it each time). Added a CSV file with all HS/COL stats accumulated during the 1935 season. Note that for this file the Primary Key is ID, not Name, as there are dupliactes in the pool.

3-17-21: With the season finished, all velocities have been updated to current values as well as scouting accuracies. Both are in terms of OSA.
