## This program is used to create queries based on statistics pulled from the in game CSV files. The beginning part
## will be used to explain the code. Below all the text will be the actual code to run. You are first using a
## database I created to then create queries so you can filter through the draft pool quicker and easier then while 
## in game and without having to open the game up. The last column is Scout Accuracy. You will want to edit the CSV
## file to change the last category to your Scouts values. You can pull up the Draft Class in game and then export
## any view that has your scout accuracy listed. You can then replace the default scout accuracy with your scouts
## and the last column is so you can type notes on the .csv file about your scouts report or (if your handy with
## SQLite/check out the tutorial) use your IDE/Code Editor to fill the empty cells. It is not perfect, but hope it 
## will help you guys out with the chaotic process that is the draft!

## To begin, you will need to download and then call sqlite. To download: 
## https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29042954/sqlite-path-environment-variable-db-browser-sqlite

## To call:

sqlite3

## Creating the database. Make sure to change the directory to your personal directory:

.open --new "D:/Documents/GitHub/Figment/Database/1934 Draft.db"

.mode column
.headers on

## Some categories have weird names: Batter GS are GS (Bat); Batter BB are Walks; Pitcher BABIP is BABIP (Opponent);
## Pitcher WAR is pWAR. Also, the `` symbol (you only need one) is needed around words that are either a function
## name (like there is a function called number), have a space (see city of Birth), or a number.

.import --csv "D:/Documents/GitHub/Figment/Data/Draft Classes/1934.csv" Players

## Here is how to build queries:

SELECT `Name`, ERA
FROM Players
WHERE ERA < 3.00
AND IP > 20
;

## This query shows all players with an ERA below 3.00. The second part is to make sure that no players with very few innings
## flood the query. If you take that part out, a lot of batters show up to.

SELECT `Name`, ERA
FROM Players
WHERE ERA < 3.00
AND IP > 20
Order By ERA
;

## As you can see, the Order By function sorts by ERA. This is ascending, while a - in front of ERA would reverse.

SELECT `Name`, ERA, Position
FROM Players
WHERE ERA < 3.00
AND IP > 20
Order By ERA
;

## The more columns you want to get generate, the more you can add. Seperate each with a comma.

SELECT `Name`, ERA, Position
FROM Players
WHERE ERA < 3.00
AND IP > 20
Order By ERA
;

## You can search for more then just numbers, as a variety of text commands can be used too.

SELECT Position, `Name`, Age, `Level`
FROM Players
WHERE `City of Birth` LIKE "%Chicago%"
Order By `Name`
;

## Check out all the Chicago kids! You can use the "% %" and the LIKE function to find all entries with text like
## what is in the quotations.

## Of course, you want to know more then just where they are from. You can add a variety of stats to the query by
## adding keys in the select area.

SELECT Position, `Name`, Age, School, `Level`, AVG, OBP, SLG, HR, RBI, SB, ERA, WHIP, BB, K, FIP
FROM Players
WHERE `City of Birth` LIKE "%Chicago%"
Order By `Name`
;

## Not a fan of the output? Fear not! You can save these queries to csv files:

.mode column 
.headers on 
.mode csv
.output D:/Documents/GitHub/Figment/Data/Chicago.csv

SELECT Position, `Name`, Age, School, `Level`, AVG, OBP, SLG, HR, RBI, SB, ERA, WHIP, BB, K, FIP
FROM Players
WHERE `City of Birth` LIKE "%Chicago%"
Order By `Name`
;

## And then, to return to the console:

.output stdout

## Enjoy the query finding! I plan on making updates, so make sure to check Github for updates. If you find any
## errors or would like to see other stats included, please let me know and I would be more then willing to help
## troubleshoot issues or add columns.

## I plan on saving all draft classes (I retroactively was able to get 1934 it is just missing a few metrics) so
## we can look back and compare current classes to past classes. I eventually hope to create another database for
## active players (and potentially all players)
