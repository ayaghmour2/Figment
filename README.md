# Figment
 A databse dedicated to the Figment Universe Out of the Park Baseball online league. The "Draft Query Tool" is a text file that you will want to run in
 some sort of IDE (integrated development environment) or code editor. SQLite
 is used for the code, and I used Visual Studio Code for it's creation.

 The text file has the database as well as a little information on how to
 create queries. This whole project is a work in progress and I expect to add
 more to it as I get more comftorable working with databases. Please let me
 know if you see any mistakes and I should be able to correct them.

 Hope you guys enjoy!
